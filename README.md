## About

My general _résumé_, in both english and portuguese, written in __LaTeX__ and
compiled with __LuaTeX__. This project also have a tiny pipeline which
compiles the documents and push them into my public S3 bucket. The compilation
is made through a docker container which have everything needed (about 4 GB of
stuff).
